# Real-time tracking of cassava-infecting geminiviruses in Africa (DNA-A)
This is the Nextstrain build for **Africa Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) DNA-A**, visible at https://nextstrain.org/community/pestdisplace/CMDAFRICA

**Cassava mosaic disease (CMD)** is currently the most important factor that limits cassava production in Africa. 
This disease is caused by different species of cassava mosaic geminivirus (genus ***Begomovirus***, family ***Geminiviridae***). 
These viruses have two components of DNA. DNA-A, you contain two ORFs in the sense of virion and a complementary sense. DNA-B has an ORF each in virion, as well as in a complementary sense.  
The viruses are transmitted in a persistent manner by the whitefly *Bemisia tabaci*, by vegetative propagation using cuttings from infected plants, and occasionally by mechanical means.
The symptoms include distortion of leaf lamina, chlorotic mosaics, mottling and an overall reduction in plant size.

## Data
CMD whole-genome sequences were retrieved from Genbank. Including 5 virus: East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV), East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV), East African cassava mosaic Uganda virus (EACMV-Ug), East African cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus (EACMZV), East African cassava mosaic Malawi virus (EACMMV), East African cassava mosaic Kenya virus (EACMKV)

Showing 314 genomes sampled between Dec 1995 and Apr 2014, for DNA-A.It has 6 genes.
